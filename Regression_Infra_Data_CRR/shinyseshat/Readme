This directory contains all the data used to run the regression analysis on pre-industrial polities. This directory contains the pre-industrial polity data published by Miranda and Freeman 2020 that updates the Seshat World 30 sample 
called Shiny Seshat. There are three data sets that represent the imputation `treatments' discussed in the SI Appendix 1.
See our python code for constructing the kinship intensity index in shiny Seshat. This directory also
contains the Seshat code book that defines all of the variables in the data set.
