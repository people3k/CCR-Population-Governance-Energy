# CCR-Population-Governance-Energy
This repository holds data and code for Freeman et al. 2022/2023 in the paper "Infrastructure and the energy use of human polities." The repository contains csv files, python code for running a principle components analysis on shiny seshat data, and r-code for running the regression analysis presented in the paper.
Within the "KinshipMetric" directory is the data and Python code used to create the kinship intensity index primarily described in the SI Appendix 1 for pre-industrial polities. Within the ``Regression_Infra_Data_CCR" directory are all of the data and r-code used to run the INLA regression analysis in the main paper.
