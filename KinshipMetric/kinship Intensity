Kinship Intensity Metric construction for Shiny Seshat.

This directory contains the data and Python 3 code used to create the kinship intensity metric for pre-industrial polities as described in the SI Appendix 1

* ``pca.py`` Begins with Shiny Seshat, creates the four imputation treatments, and runs a principal component analysis on each in order to generate the kinship intensity metric.
* ``plot_pca.py`` Generates plots for the loadings and explained variance of the PCA. These plots are also featured in the SI Appendix 1.
